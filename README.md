# linearprogramming

This repository is the companion of the book *Modeling and solving linear programming with R* available at:

http://bit.ly/1JZiSUd

Here you will find the code of the solverLP function, that returns the solution of a linear model written in CPLEX format, and the CPLEX implementations of the examples in the book (the .mod files). We have also included two examples where the parameters of the linear model are generated using R code (the P08.R and P10.R files).

We hope that this book will be useful to all people interested in applying linear programming and solving models using open source software.
