# linearprogramming

This repository is the companion of the book *Modeling and solving linear programming with R* available at:

Here you will find the code of the **solverLP** function, that returns the solution of a linear model written in LP/CPLEX or MathProg format. The examplesSolverLP.R file demonstrates how to use the function.

The LP/CPLEX implementations of the examples in the book can be found in the **LP** folder. We have also included two examples where the parameters of the linear model are generated using R code in the **MatricialInput** folder, and examples of use of **MathProg** in the folder of the same name. We have also included a script with examples of 

We hope that this book will be useful to all people interested in applying linear programming and solving models using open source software.
