#Stacking of graded papers problem

*I would like to thank Wayne Smith for proposing this problem*

Letâ€™s suppose that we have a set of graded papers, which have to be sorted alphabetically to be delivered to students, so that we have a vector *m* of length 26, whose components are equal to the number of papers corresponding to students of the same initial in the family name. We have to stack the papers in *n* bins, so that the number of papers of each bin are as evenly distributed as possible.

A way to tackle this problem using ILP is to minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum number of papers in each bin. Then variables such as x_{ij} can be defined which equal one if students with family name starting with letter *j* go to bin *i* and zero otherwise (so we cannot split papers with the same initial across two bins). Then we have the following sets of constraints:

* constraints to obtain the maximum and minimum
* each letter goes in one bin
* letters must be set in order

Here is an implementation of the problem in MathProg syntax using four bins. I have used data from the distribution of initials of English family names I have found somewhere. The implementation can be found for convenience in the file `letters.mod`.

```
minimize z: ma - mi;
/* minimize difference between max and min number of items */

s.t. ass{j in 1..m}: sum{i in 1..n} x[i, j] = 1;
/* each letter goes only in one bin */

s.t. mini{i in 1..n}: sum{j in 1..m} list[j] * x[i, j] - mi >=0;
s.t. maxi{i in 1..n}: sum{j in 1..m} list[j] * x[i, j] - ma <=0;
/*obtaining maximum and minimum in any bin */

s.t. order{i in 1..n, j in 2..m}: sum{k in 1..i} x[k, j-1] - x[i,j] >= 0; 
/*if letter j goes in bin i, letter j-1 must go in same bin or previous ones */

Integer feasibility conditions:

KKT.PE: max.abs.err = 0.00e+00 on row 0
        max.rel.err = 0.00e+00 on row 0
        High quality

KKT.PB: max.abs.err = 0.00e+00 on row 0
        max.rel.err = 0.00e+00 on row 0
        High quality

End of output
```

Then, according to the obtained solution, graded papers can be conveniently stored in four stacks:

* Letters A to D
* Letters E to K
* Letters L to R
* Letters S to Z

The MathProg implementation can be modified conveniently to adjust to any letter distribution.
